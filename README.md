Hi. I just recently graduated with my MS in statistics. I figured I needed a place to house all of my random functions and explorations that I encountered in the process of creating my thesis.

All of my files involve atmospheric geopotential height data that can be found at https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis.derived.pressure.html

My thesis involved looking at the structure of atmospheric pressure waves at certain pressure heights (500mb) to try to identify extreme atmospheric activity. It uses Topological Data Analysis to find "features" and compares them vs a baseline that we create using the same process. The hope is that it leads to some type of inference.
